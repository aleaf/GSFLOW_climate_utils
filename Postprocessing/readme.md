#### Aggregating and visualizing GSFLOW results from multiple climate scenario runs
Non-standard package requirements:  
pandas  
seaborn ([http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/](http://)); used to make the box and violin plots

1. run **aggregate_GSFLOW.py** on results folder
  (aggregate and plot results from multiple GSFLOW climate scenario runs)
   * uses functions in **GSFLOW_utils.py**
   * aggregates results by variable.scenario (one csv for each, which a column of daily results for each GCM)
   * assumes that all results are in zip files (one per run) within a specified *results_folder*

2. run **plots.py** to generate plots.
   * input parameters (input/output paths; gcms and scenarios to include, plot colors, etc.) are hard-coded into **plots.py**
   * **plots.py** calls the ReportFigures class in **climate_plots**, which sets all of the figure specifications and makes the plots.
   * **climate_stats.py** is used to calculate period statistics for the plots
   * plot types inlude
     * **time series** of annual average values, with means for all GCMs overlaid on fillbetween plots of min/max values
     * **box plots** showing the distributions of monthly mean values or monthly totals among all GCM-future emissions scenario combinations
     * **box plots** showing the distributions of mean values or average annual totals among all GCM-future emissions scenario combinations, for different time periods
     * **violin plots** showing the distributions of mean values or average annual totals among all GCM-future emissions scenario combinations, for different time periods (see seaborn documentation)
   * information for the plots (title, ylabel, whether data should be summed or averaged for each time period, etc.) can be
     1. inferred from the GSFLOW **.var_name** file, using functions in **GSFLOW_utils.py**. The *.var_name* file, which has meta information on all of the GSFLOW variables. This file can be generated by running GSFLOW in print mode: gsflow.exe <*.control> -print  
     2. read from a **GSFLOW_variables** file such as the one in this folder. This is a better approach because the aggregation operations and naming can be manually edited. The **make_var_table()** function in **GSFLOW_utils.py** can be used to build an initial table (in csv format), which can then be edited and used subsequently to make plots.
